# AutocommenterOnAnywhere

We often find that our friends gives us challenge line 25000 comment and i will do this or that. Here is the solution to your problem. Just clone the repository. 

You will need to install some modules first. 

**Modules:**
- pyautogui
- time 

**Instructions:**

After installing, you can edit the textfile and put any text you want to comment. *Remember that the comment will be done based on each line.* 
Then just run the script by 
- opening cmd or terminal 
- navigate to the directory where the clone is saved 
- write ```py script.py``` (for windows) or ```python3 script.py``` and ***you will have to click to the commentbox of the post where you want to autocomment*** within the next 10 seconds.

**Notes:**

- Dont use the script frequently.
